# Main concepts

<span class="concept">Quality Gates</span> : Set of boolean conditions based on measure thresholds 
**against which projects are measured during a period**. 

```
Blocker Issues equals 0
Code Coverage is greater than 80%
```

<span class="concept">Rules</span>: rules are executed on source to generate issues. Three basic types of rules: **Reliability**, **Maintainability** and **Security**
<p>Rule definition:</p>

- Language
- Type: bug, vulnerability, code smell
- Tag
- Repository
- Status: beta, deprecated, ready

Example:
```
".equals()" should not be used to test the values of "Atomic" classes
Language: Java
Type: bug
Tag: multi-threading
Repository: N/A
Status: ready
```

<span class="concept">Quality profiles</span> : Collections of rules to apply during an analysis.
Each language has a default profile

<span class="concept">Metric</span> : A type of measurement. Examples: number of lines of code, number of duplicated blocks, complexity etc.

<span class="concept">Reliability</span> : code that can produce operational risks or unexpected behavior at runtime. Must of time it's the consequence of lack of compliance with best practice
